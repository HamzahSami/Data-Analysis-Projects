## Project Workflow

- Analyzed thousands of records of medical appointments in Brazil. Goal is to determine a way for patients to stop no-showing their medical appointments.
- Programmed in Python and completed in Jupyter Notebook.

## Research Questions

- Does the neighborhood affect why people don't make it to their appts?
- Does scholarship status affect why there are so many no-shows?
- Does the difference between scheduling an appt and going to the appt affect the chance of a no-show?
- Do SMS messages actually help prevent no-shows?

## Conclusion

95% of people do not no-show their medical appointments when they schedule an appointment on the same day.
